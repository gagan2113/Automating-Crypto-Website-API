# Automating Crypto Website API for Data Analysis

## Overview
This project automates the retrieval of cryptocurrency data using the **CoinMarketCap API** and processes it for data analysis. The script fetches real-time market data, including price, volume, and other key metrics, allowing users to analyze trends and make informed decisions.

## Features
- Fetches the latest cryptocurrency listings
- Extracts data such as price, market cap, and volume
- Automates API requests and handles errors
- Processes and formats the data for analysis

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:

```bash
pip install requests pandas
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_link>
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python crypto_data_analysis.py
   ```
3. The script will fetch and display cryptocurrency data.

## API Key Setup
To use the **CoinMarketCap API**, obtain an API key from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) and replace it in the script:

```python
headers = {
  'Accepts': 'application/json',
  'X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY': 'your_api_key_here',
}
```

## Data Processing
- The retrieved JSON data is parsed and converted into a structured format using **Pandas**.
- Data can be further analyzed using statistical and visualization tools.

## Error Handling
The script includes error handling for:
- **Connection Errors**
- **Timeouts**
- **Invalid API Responses**

## Future Enhancements
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of trends.
- **Database Storage**: Storing data for long-term analysis.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Using machine learning for price prediction.
